# API Relay
A lightweight and convenient Chrome extension that provides a sidebar to quickly test your API endpoints without leaving your current tab. Send GET and POST requests, add custom headers, and view responses in multiple formats.

## üíØ Why Use This Extension?
As a developer, you often need to quickly check an API endpoint or test a response. Switching between your browser, a code editor, and a dedicated API client like Postman can be cumbersome. This extension solves that by bringing a simple yet powerful API testing tool directly into your browser's sidebar. It's perfect for rapid testing, debugging, and development workflows.

## üìö How to Use
1. __Open the Sidebar__: Click the extension's icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the sidebar.
2. __Select Method__: Choose either __GET__ or __POST__ for your request.
3. __Enter URL__: Paste the full API endpoint URL you want to test.
4. __Add Headers__ (optional):
    - Click the + Add Header button to create a new header row.
    - Enter the header name (e.g., `x-rapidapi-key`) and its value.
    - Add as many headers as you need.
5. __Add Body__ (for POST): If you selected POST, a body field will appear. Enter your JSON payload here.
6. __Send Request__: Click the Send Request button.
7. __View Response__: The response will appear at the bottom. You can switch between different views:
    - Auto: Automatically detects if the response is JSON, an image, or plain text.
    - Text: Shows the raw text body of the response.
    - Image: Attempts to render the response as an image.
    - Headers: Displays the status code and all response headers.
