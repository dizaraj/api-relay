# Privacy Policy for API Relay
__Effective Date__: August 5, 2025

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how the API Relay Chrome Extension ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is critically important to us. Our fundamental policy is that we do not collect any of your personal data.

## Information We Collect
__We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information.__

The data you enter into the extension, such as:
- API endpoint URLs
- Request headers (including keys and values)
- Request bodies (JSON payloads)

is processed entirely on your local machine. This information is used exclusively to make the API requests you initiate and is never sent to our servers or any third party.

## How We Use Your Information
Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use your information in any way. The data you provide is used only for the core functionality of the extension, which is to send an API request from your browser to the server you specify.

## Permissions Explained
The extension requires the following permissions to function correctly:

- `"sidePanel"`: Allows the extension to display its user interface in the browser's side panel.
- `"activeTab"`: Used to enable the side panel on your current tab. The extension does not read, track, or alter the content of any webpage you visit.

## Data Storage
All request data you enter is stored locally on your computer using the standard Chrome Storage API. This data is under your control and can be cleared at any time by clearing your browser data or by uninstalling the extension.

## Third-Party Services
This extension does not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
